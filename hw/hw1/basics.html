        <h3>Variables</h3>

                <p id="variable-text-left">If you want to declare a variable, for example, a sum that will change at a later time, using the keyword <strong>var</strong> will be what you 
                want to use.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="variables">
                <img src="img/basics/let_example.png" alt="An example of declaring variable using let"></img> <br>
                <p id="variable-text-right">However, if you want to declare something that will not change you should be using the keyword <strong>let</strong>.</p>
            </div>
        </aside>
        
        
        <p>You may be wondering why I explicitly wrote the type of the variable for lastName but not for name. In reality it is not neccessary to do so 
        because Swift has <strong>type inference</strong>. With type inference you can avoid the extra typing if you know the only possible type for that 
        variable is what you want it to be. However, in some occassions type inference will be wrong and you will need to tell Swift exactly the type of 
        variable you want. For example if you declare <strong>var sum = 0</strong> and at a later time attempt to add a <strong>float</strong> you will 
        be unable to because Swift interprets sum as a float. To get around this you would type <strong>var sum:Float = 0</strong>. Now when you attempt 
        to add a float to the sum you will be able to, but don't take my word for it, try it for yourself.</p>
        
        <br>To try it yourself, do the following. <br>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Launch Xcode
            </li>
            <li>
                To do everything here the playground will be more than enough. Click on "Get started with a playground" <br>
                <img src="img/start_window.png" alt="screen seen when Xcode is opened"></img>
            </li>
            <li>
                Select the Blank template and click "next" <br>
                <img src="img/basics/playground/second_window.png" alt="screen seen when clickin on playground"></img>
            </li>
            <li>
                Name the file whatever you want and save it in your desired location and click "create". <br>
                <img src="img/basics/playground/third_window.png" alt="Screen seen when clicking next."></img>
            </li>
        </ol>
        
        
        <h3>Printing</h3>
        <p>When making an iOS application, the use of the <strong>print()</strong> function will not show the user anything, but this is a great tool to use 
        for debugging your code. To use the <strong>print</strong> funtion simply type <strong>print("My string")</strong>. This will
        print out "My string" to the console. To print out a variable simple do the following: <strong>print(variableName)</strong>.</p>
