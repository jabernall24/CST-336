        <p><tab></tab>So now that you have the Hello World app under your belt let's go with something a little more complex, 
        a random number generator app that the user can interact with! At the end of this app, the user will be able to enter a 
        lower and upper bound and we will give them a random number between that range. We will have a simple error checking to 
        make sure that the users upper bound is indeed greater than the lower bound. Are you ready to get started? We will go ahead 
        and start off from our Hello World app since the inital setup to do everything programatically is already done. The first thing
        I will ask you to do is to delete the label contraints and to rename the label constant to something more meaningful like, 
        randomNumberLabel and also delete the line where we set the text to "Hello World" since we won't be needing it. After doing so, 
        you should have the following and if you run the app you will see a white screen.</p>

        <p><tab></tab>For this lesson, I will take a slightly different approach. I will be showing you code snippets
        of what we will be doing and then explain what each line does. So let's get started making our RNG app!</p>
