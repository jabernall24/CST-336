        For your first app we will be making the infamous hello world app as is tradition. Let's get started with launching Xcode.
        
        Click on Create a new Xcode project <br>
        <img src="img/start_window.png" alt=""/> <br> <br>
        We will be making a single view application. <br>
        <img src="img/second_window.png" alt=""/> <br> <br>
        In product name go ahead and put the name of the app. I will call this hello world. <br>
        Go ahead and put down your organization name. For me it is just my name. It does not matter what it is. <br>
        The organization identifier is usually com.yourOrganizationName <br>
        Swift as your languague and leave the three boxes unticked we will not be working with any of them. <br>

        Finally go ahead and save it where ever you want and click create.<br> <br>
