        For your first app we will be making the infamous hello world app as is tradition. Let's get started with launching Xcode.
        
        Click on Create a new Xcode project <br>
        <img src="img/start_window.png" alt=""/> <br> <br>
        We will be making a single view application. <br>
        <img src="img/second_window.png" alt=""/> <br> <br>
        In product name go ahead and put the name of the app. I will call this hello world. <br>
        Go ahead and put down your organization name. For me it is just my name. It does not matter what it is. <br>
        The organization identifier is usually com.yourOrganizationName <br>
        Swift as your languague and leave the three boxes unticked we will not be working with any of them. <br>
        <img src="img/third_window.png" alt=""/> <br> <br>
        Finally go ahead and save it where ever you want and click create.<br> <br>
        
        <p>Before we do anything, let's go ahead and run our application. If all is going well, we should see a white screen.
        To run the application go ahead and click on the little play button near the top left.</p>
        
        <p>You may be asking yourself, what are we going to make? Well, we will be making a simple Hello World app. To do this in storyboard
        it is dragging and dropping onto it and it is not really programming in my opinion. We will be doing the app fully programatically. By doing the app 
        fully programatically it will make working on a team easier because changing one little thing in the storyboard changes the whole storyboard file making it 
        very difficult to resolve those conflicts. Also, you are trying to learn to program so it is a good idea to get used to looking at code. So let's get started.</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>
                Double click on the Main.storyboard file and delete it(move to trash). <br>
                <img src="img/first_app/step1.png" alt="deleting Main.storyboard image"/>
            </li>
            <li>
                Delete the 'Main' from the Main Interface.
                <img src="img/first_app/step2.png" alt="deleting Main from main interface"/>
            </li>
            <li>
                Head over to your AppDelegate.swift file and inside your didFinishLaunchingWithOptions funtion and write the following three lines.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        These three lines tells our program, 'Hey, when you start up head over to ViewController.swift file'. When working
                        fully programatically these three lines are extremely important or else our app will crash.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <img src="img/first_app/step3.png" alt="writing the three lines of code to allow our program to run"/>
            </li>
        </ol>
            
            <br><br>
            
            Now when you run it you should see a black screen. <br><br>
            
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Go to your ViewController.swift file and inside <strong>viewDidLoad()</strong> we will be changing the background
                    color to white by typing: <strong class="code">view.backgroundColor = .white</strong> below super.viewDidLoad()
                </li>
                <li>
                    Run it and your screen should be white again as when we started.
                </li>
            </ol>
            
            <h2>Now let's make the label that will say "Hello World"</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Let's start by making out label a constant, giving it the name label and telling Xcode we want it to be 
                    a UILabel. To do so type the following: <strong class="code">let label: UILabel = { }()</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Inside the curly braces({}) is where the information about our label goes. Let's start off by typing in 
                    the following two lines <strong class="code">let l = UILabel()</strong> and <strong class="code">return l</strong>. The first line 
                    creates a constant l and sets it equal to a UILabel() the second line returns the label to our constant label.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Next we need to tell Xcode we will be using auto layout for that just type the following: 
                    <strong class="code">l.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false</strong> in between the two lines we just wrote.
                    If you are interested in learing more about translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints you can head over to the 
                    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622572-translatesautoresizingmaskintoco">Apple Documentation.</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Above our return, let's give our label some text, <strong class="code">l.text = "Hello World"</strong>.
                </li>
                <li>Below our text let's make our font a bit bigger, <strong class="code">l.font = UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 36)</strong></li>
                <li>
                    Now let's center it, <strong class="code">l.textAlignment = .center</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Let's give our text some color, <strong class="code">l.textColor = </strong> and start typing in color literal,
                    you will see auto complete com up. Go on the one that says Color Literal and hit return. Double click on the new square
                    on the right side of the equal sign and choose your favorite color.
                    <br><img src="img/first_app/color_literal.png" alt="image to help know what you should be looking for in auto complete"/>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <br><br>
            Your code should look like this. <br>
            <img src="img/first_app/label_finished.png" alt="Image of how code should look like so far"/>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>However, we are not done because if your run the program you will still see the white screen. Where the 
            hell is our label you may ask? Well it is our fault because we have yet to add it to our view. To add it to our view it
            very simple actually just by doing the following: <strong class="code">view.addSubview(label)</strong> below 
            <strong class="code">view.backgroundColor = .white</strong> inside of viewDidLoad. However, we also need to give our label 
            constraints. We need to contraint the top, bottom, left(leading) and right(trailing). However in our case our top and bottom 
            will be centering in the x and y positions. We will anchor it by doing the following:</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <img src="img/first_app/constraining.png" alt="Image of contraining code"/>
            
            <br><br>
            Now when you run it, you will see "Hello World" printed out on the simulator.
            
            <img src="img/first_app/completed.png" alt="completed app"/>
            
            <br><br>
            
            Congrats you have completed your first app, for an app that is a little bit more complex, head over
